    The goal of this project is to calculate if the amount a coin is worth is 
    actually worth the space it occupie=s. For example, in Dublin, for the more
    expensive areas of the city it has become unprofitable to keep a coin of 
    1 cent inside your house as you are paying more rent for the space it occupies
    than 1 cent. The application can calculate for Dollars, Euros, Australian and
    Canadian Dollars, as well as for Yuan and Yen. It takes into consideration all
    available coins in circulation.`;

jQuery and using a basic HTML and Bootstrap skeleton. The game begins by
selecting the level of difficulty which can vary from very easy to insanely
hard. The player is given 20 cards, with 10 pairs of custom drawn cartoons,
all facing down. The player will then select one card at a time, trying 
to remember the drawing on the back. Each selected card will remain facing
upwards until a third card is selected, moment in which the previously 
selected two cards will be hidden again. In accordance with the difficulty
selected, the player has a limited amount of clicks and a limited amount of
time in which they have to find all 10 pairs using memory and dexterity skills`;
