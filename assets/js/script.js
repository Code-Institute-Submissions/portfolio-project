    expensive areas of the city it has become unprofitable to keep a coin of 
    1 cent inside your house as you are paying more rent for the space it occupies
    than 1 cent. The application can calculate for Dollars, Euros, Australian and

upwards until a third card is selected, moment in which the previously 
selected two cards will be hidden again. In accordance with the difficulty
selected, the player has a limited amount of clicks and a limited amount of
